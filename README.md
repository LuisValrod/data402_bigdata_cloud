# Cloud Computing


## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics, over the internet (“the cloud”). These services provide flexible resources and economies of scale, allowing users to access and store data and run applications without needing to manage physical hardware directly. It is like renting computing power instead of owning it. It provides on-demand access to computer system resources like data storage (cloud storage) and processing power, delivered over the internet. You don't need to directly manage these resources yourself.

## How do we know if something is in the cloud?

You can identify if a service or application is in the cloud if:

- It is accessed via the internet.
- It does not require installation on local hardware.
- It offers scalability and is managed remotely by a cloud service provider.
- Data and applications are stored on remote servers.

If you're accessing data or software through the internet from a remote server instead of your local computer, it's likely in the cloud.  For example, Gmail or Netflix are cloud-based services.

## Differences between on-prem and the cloud?

- On-Premises:

  - Infrastructure: Managed and maintained internally by the organization.
  - Control: Full control over hardware, software, and data.
  - Cost: High initial capital expenditure (CapEx) for hardware and software, ongoing operational expenditure (OpEx) for maintenance.
  - Scalability: Limited by physical resources and requires additional investment to scale.
  <br>
- Cloud:

  - Infrastructure: Provided and maintained by a third-party cloud service provider.
  - Control: Less control over the underlying hardware and infrastructure.
  - Cost: Lower initial CapEx; ongoing OpEx based on usage.
  - Scalability: Highly scalable with on-demand resources.
 
<br>

**Summary**<br>
 Traditional on-premise IT involves having your own physical servers and hardware on-site. On the other hand, the cloud offers a more flexible and scalable alternative, where resources are provided by a cloud service provider.

## The 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud

1. Private Cloud:
- Definition: Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization.
- Control: High, as the infrastructure can be hosted internally or externally but is dedicated to one organization.
- Use Case: Industries with strict security and compliance requirements, like finance and healthcare.

2. Public Cloud:
- Definition: Cloud infrastructure offered to the general public or a large industry group and owned by a cloud service provider.
- Control: Lower, with shared resources among multiple organizations.
- Use Case: General use, web-based applications, startups, and small to medium businesses.- 

3. Hybrid Cloud:  
- Definition: A combination of private and public cloud services that allows data and applications to be shared between them.
- Control: Moderate, combining the benefits of both private and public clouds.
- Use Case: Businesses needing flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency while maintaining some control over sensitive data.
  
4. Multi-Cloud:
- Definition: The use of multiple cloud services from different providers.
- Control: Complex management across multiple platforms.
- Use Case: Organizations aiming to avoid vendor lock-in, improve redundancy, and leverage the strengths of different providers.

## Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
- Definition: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Provides the building blocks like virtual machines (VMs) and storage. You have control over the operating system and configurations.
- Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Use Case: Businesses needing scalable and flexible computing power.<br>

2.Platform as a Service (PaaS):
- Definition: Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. Offers a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applicationsThink pre-configured servers with development tools.
- Examples: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Services, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- Use Case: Developers building and deploying applications efficiently.<br>

3.Software as a Service (SaaS):
- Definition: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Delivers ready-made applications accessible over the internet.
- Examples: Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Gmail.
- Use Case: End-users requiring ready-to-use applications without handling software maintenance.

## Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud for Businesses
- Advantages:

  - Cost Efficiency: Reduced CapEx, lower maintenance costs, and pay-as-you-go pricing.
  - Scalability: Easily scalable resources to match demand.
  - Accessibility: Access from anywhere with an internet connection.
  - Disaster Recovery: Enhanced backup and recovery options.
    
-Disadvantages:

  - Security and Privacy: Potential concerns over data security and privacy.
  - Downtime: Dependence on internet connectivity and potential provider outages.
  - Limited Control: Less control over infrastructure and performance.
  - Compliance: Challenges in meeting regulatory requirements.

**Summary**<br>
Whereas the cloudh can have several advantages for businesses like scalability, Cost-efficiency (pay-as-you-go), Improved disaster recovery, Increased collaboration, Automatic updates; it can also have few disadvantages like Security concerns, Vendor lock-in, Potential performance issues, Reliance on internet connectivity. 

## Difference between OpEx vs CapEx and how it relates the cloud
- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: Large, upfront investments in physical assets, such as servers and data centers.
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: Ongoing costs for services, like cloud subscriptions and maintenance.
In cloud computing, businesses shift from a CapEx model (buying and maintaining hardware) to an OpEx model (paying for services as needed), which can improve cash flow and reduce financial risk.

**Summary**<br>
OpEx (Operational Expenditure) is the ongoing cost of using a service, while CapEx (Capital Expenditure) is the upfront cost of buying something. Cloud services typically follow an OpEx model, reducing upfront costs for businesses.

## Is Migrating to the Cloud Always Cheaper?
Not necessarily. While cloud computing can reduce certain costs, the total cost depends on various factors such as:

- Current infrastructure and how it's utilized.
- Specific cloud service requirements and usage patterns.
- Long-term subscription costs versus upfront hardware investment.
- Potential hidden costs such as data transfer fees, storage, and additional services.

## Market Share Breakdown
As of the latest data, the major players in the cloud market are:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS): Approximately 31%.

Betabrand is a crowd-funded, crowd-sourced retail clothing e-commerce company. They migrated from a bare metal infrastructure to the cloud due to maintenance difficulties and lack of scalability. The migration process was smooth and simple, and they were able to quickly create a replica of their production services for load testing12. The scalability of the cloud infrastructure helped them avoid downtime and keep customers satisfied <br>

### Spotify <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRNaTV_VD20fcjJ6KVMVDsK097njrbIkBZGpQ&s" width="30">
Spotify, a media services provider primarily focused on its audio-streaming platform, migrated from in-house data centers to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The company’s leadership and engineering team agreed that their massive in-house data centers were difficult to provision and maintain, and they didn’t directly serve the company’s goal of being the "best music service in the world". They wanted to free up Spotify’s engineers to focus on innovation. <br>
