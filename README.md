## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics, over the internet (“the cloud”). These services provide flexible resources and economies of scale, allowing users to access and store data and run applications without needing to manage physical hardware directly. It is like renting computing power instead of owning it. It provides on-demand access to computer system resources like data storage (cloud storage) and processing power, delivered over the internet. You don't need to directly manage these resources yourself.

## How do we know if something is in the cloud?

You can identify if a service or application is in the cloud if:

- It is accessed via the internet.
- It does not require installation on local hardware.
- It offers scalability and is managed remotely by a cloud service provider.
- Data and applications are stored on remote servers.

If you're accessing data or software through the internet from a remote server instead of your local computer, it's likely in the cloud.  For example, Gmail or Netflix are cloud-based services.

## Differences between on-prem and the cloud?

- On-Premises:

  - Infrastructure: Managed and maintained internally by the organization.
  - Control: Full control over hardware, software, and data.
  - Cost: High initial capital expenditure (CapEx) for hardware and software, ongoing operational expenditure (OpEx) for maintenance.
  - Scalability: Limited by physical resources and requires additional investment to scale.
  <br>
- Cloud:

  - Infrastructure: Provided and maintained by a third-party cloud service provider.
  - Control: Less control over the underlying hardware and infrastructure.
  - Cost: Lower initial CapEx; ongoing OpEx based on usage.
  - Scalability: Highly scalable with on-demand resources.

In that repo, make in an appropriate section for cloud (or similar) + a README.md

In the README.md, add + personalise the content with your own comments, "take-aways", things you've learnt. Supplement the content with extra research where you feel your understanding is weaker.
 
Understand the content so you are ready to be asked interview questions on the topic
 
We may allocate more time for this after lunch. No need to post links yet.
